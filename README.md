# Swift Higher Order Functions
 Higher Order Functions in Swift
 
 
Higher order functions in Swift are extremely powerful tools to have in your developer toolkit, the only issue is that it might take some time to get comfortable with them. Before we get started, let’s have a look at some important terms to know in relation with higher order functions:
 
Collections - a sequence whose elements can be traversed multiple times, nondestructively, and accessed by an indexed subscript.
 
Closures - self-contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and used in your code.
 
Shorthand arguments - Swift automatically provides shorthand argument names to inline closures, which can be used to refer to the values of the closure’s arguments by the names $0, $1, $2, and so on.
 
Optional - A type that represents either a wrapped value or nil, the absence of a value.
 

Those function are Map, Filter, Reduce, Sort, CompactMap, Chaining, Contains, Partition.
